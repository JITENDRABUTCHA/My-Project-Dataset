      <h1>
        Overview
      </h1>
      <p>Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.<br>

        Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.<br>
        
        A mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at school or work or in relationships. In most cases, symptoms can be managed with a combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Symptoms</h1>
      <p>Signs and symptoms of mental illness can vary, depending on the disorder, circumstances and other factors. Mental illness symptoms can affect emotions, thoughts and behaviors.<br>

        <ol>
        <li>Feeling sad or down</li>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>When to approach a doctor</h1>
      <p>If you have any signs or symptoms of a mental illness, see your primary care provider or a mental health professional. Most mental illnesses don't improve on their own, and if untreated, a mental illness may get worse over time and cause serious problems.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h1>suicidal thoughts</h1>
    <p>Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common with some mental illnesses. If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, get help right away:<br>

      Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.<br>
      Call your mental health specialist.<br>
      Contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat. Services are free and confidential.<br>
      Seek help from your primary care provider.<br>
      Reach out to a close friend or loved one.<br>
      Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1>Diagnosis</h1>
    <p>To determine a diagnosis and check for related complications, you may have:<br>

     <h3> A physical exam. </h3>Your doctor will try to rule out physical problems that could cause your symptoms.
      Lab tests. These may include, for example, a check of your thyroid function or a screening for alcohol and drugs.
      <h3>A psychological evaluation. </h3>A doctor or mental health professional talks to you about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1>Determining which mental illness I have</h1>
    <p>Sometimes it's difficult to find out which mental illness may be causing your symptoms. But taking the time and effort to get an accurate diagnosis will help determine the appropriate treatment. The more information you have, the more you will be prepared to work with your mental health professional in understanding what your symptoms may represent.<br>

      The defining symptoms for each mental illness are detailed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. This manual is used by mental health professionals to diagnose mental conditions and by insurance companies to reimburse for treatment.

The most notable example is schizophrenia, although other classes of disorders can be associated with detachment from reality at times.<br>
      <h3>Bipolar and related disorders.</h3> This class includes disorders with alternating episodes of mania — periods of excessive activity, energy and excitement — and depression.<br>
      <h3>Depressive disorders.</h3> These include disorders that affect how you feel emotionally, such as the level of sadness and happiness, and they can disrupt your ability to function. Examples include major depressive disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.<br>
      <h3>Anxiety disorders.</h3> Anxiety is an emotion characterized by the anticipation of future danger or misfortune, along with excessive worrying. It can include behavior aimed at avoiding situations that cause anxiety. This class includes generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and phobias.<br>

          <h1>Treatment</h1>
          <p>Your treatment depends on the type of mental illness you have, its severity and what works best for you. In many cases, a combination of treatments works best.<br>

            If you have a mild mental illness with well-controlled symptoms, treatment from your primary care provider may be sufficient. However, often a team approach is appropriate to make sure all your psychiatric, medical and social needs are met. This is especially important for severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>Treatment team</h1>
          <ul type="square">

            <li>Physician assistant</li>
            <li>Psychiatrist, a medical doctor who diagnoses and treats mental illnesses</li>

        <div>
          <h1>Psychotherapy</h1>
          <p>Psychotherapy, also called talk therapy, involves talking about your condition and related issues with a mental health professional. During psychotherapy, you learn about your condition and your moods, feelings, thoughts and behavior. With the insights and knowledge you gain, you can learn coping and stress management skills.<br>

            There are many types of psychotherapy, each with its own approach to improving your mental well-being. Psychotherapy often can be successfully completed in a few months, but in some cases, long-term treatment may be needed. It can take place one-on-one, in a group or with family members.<br>
            
            When choosing a therapist, you should feel comfortable and be confident that he or she is capable of listening and hearing what you have to say. Also, it's important that your therapist understands the life journey that has helped shape who you are and how you live in the world.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>Brain stimulation treatments</h1>
          <p>Brain-stimulation treatments are sometimes used for depression and other mental health disorders. They're generally reserved for situations in which medications and psychotherapy haven't worked.<br> They include electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation.<br>

            Make sure you understand all the risks and benefits of any recommended treatment.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>Hospital treatment programs</h1>
          <p>Sometimes mental illness becomes so severe that you need care in a psychiatric hospital.<br> This is generally recommended when you can't care for yourself properly or when you're in immediate danger of harming yourself or someone else.<br>

            Options include 24-hour inpatient care, partial or day hospitalization, or residential treatment, which offers a temporary supportive place to live. Another option may be intensive outpatient treatment</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>Substance misuse treatment</h1>
          <p>Problems with substance use commonly occur along with mental illness. Often it interferes with treatment and worsens mental illness. If you can't stop using drugs or alcohol on your own, you need treatment. Talk to your doctor about treatment options.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>own treatment</h1>
          <p>Working together, you and your primary care provider or mental health professional can decide which treatment may be best, depending on your symptoms and their severity, your personal preferences, medication side effects, and other factors. In some cases, a mental illness may be so severe that a doctor or loved one may need to guide your care until you're well enough to participate in decision-making.</p>
